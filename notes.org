* Eggjam 20 - Rhythms & Layers + Loving Mondays
** Ideas
   - Autorunner platformer where you swap between different layers of
     foreground & background
   - Single screen rhythm game where you try to hit different buttons
     on different layers that reflect the song
   - Play as an AI in charge of regulating a space station / asteroid
     habitat / etc.
     + Rhythm by way of the changing days
     + Layers by way of the different interplay of systems _massive hand wave_
     + In addition to regular systems  you have semi-random inputs &
       outputs such as trade delegations, refugee crises, solar
       storms, etc
     + A fixed number of actions per day as the resource
     + Various degress of "success" (as judged by the player)
       measured: population size, health standards, wealth standards,
       political power, trading power, harmony, research, spirituality
     + Means the game is mostly UI, with a little gfx and wanting of
       solid music & pleasant sfx
* The game where you play as an AI running a space habitat
** Story
   So you've just turned up to run a space habitat after the previous
   overeer moved on to better things. Your job is to make all the
   things go and ensure none of the things stop that shouldn't stop.
** Gameplay
  Basic actions:
  - Attend to daily jobs (some button clicking for now)
  - Respond to regular events (more button clicking)
  Rhythms:
  - Each day, except Monday, has at least one required job.
*** Habitat daily jobs
    Either have these done on different days or require only a certain
    amount done in a given timeframe. Probably not all every day.
    - Feed waste to energy source -> increases energy
    - Rotate hydroponics racks -> uses energy, increases terrarium
    - Check life systems -> uses energy, increases life systems
    - Push life sustaining feedback cycles -> ???
    - Correct position of habitat -> uses energy, increases efficiency
    - Heat systems enjiggered -> uses energy, increases life systems
    - Check visitors and incoming cargo -> increases efficiency
    - Reply to general questions -> increases happniess
**** Mini game ideas
     - Feed reactor :: Puzzle Bobble style aim at a fixed/moving target
     - Hydroponics rack :: slot machine style rotating objects that
          need to be stopped in place
     - Check life systems :: Autorunner repairing issues as they appear
     - Correct habitat pos :: dodge 'em up? simplified pool game?
     - Heat sinks coordinated :: a rhythm-type game where scrolling
          ribbons are aligned
     - Land incoming ships :: catch falling ships
     - Patch shield holes :: some kind of whack-a-mole
     - Reply to questions :: Multiple choice questions
     - Trading negotiations :: pong–like
     - Asteroid storm :: missile–command–like
     - Disease outbreak :: wave shoot'em up against virii
*** Resources
    - Time / turns
    - Energy?
    - Matter?
    - Diplomacy?
*** Measures
    - Energy (?)
    - Terrarium system
    - Life systems (air, gravity, heat)
    - Happiness
    - Efficiency
    - Shielding
*** Rate of change
    - Energy usage
    - Matter total
    - Terrarium deterioration
** Misc code
*** Draw a circle in pico8
